#net.srussell framework library

## aka Mr.Obj does Java

###This is a little library of POJO that I've found useful over the years. 

Included is a handy method of capturing an event (such as an exception) and having a configurable method of delivery (STDOUT & email are provided). A logging manager with some convenience methods. Some basic file/directory utility methods. 

To get a better idea about what's inside you can purse the [JavaDoc](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?http://github.com/DTownSMR/framework/blob/master/doc/index.html?overview-summary.html)
